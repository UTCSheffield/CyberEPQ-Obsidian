## Your Challenge

AI has transformed the security landscape, and in 2025, IT leaders will need to protect against increasingly savvy threat actors. From dealing with typical attack vectors, such as phishing and credential capture attacks, to limitless possibilities for new vectors such as deepfakes and quantum computing, IT leaders will have to move far past reactive security. They will need to balance their approach and spend across the triad of people, process, and technology in the year to come.

The Security Priorities 2025 report highlights five key areas of focus in the fast-evolving security environment.

## Our Advice

#### Critical Insight

## Cyber threats are evolving rapidly. So should security priorities.

AI has transformed the security landscape, and in 2025, IT leaders will need to protect against increasingly savvy threat actors. From dealing with typical attack vectors, such as phishing and credential capture attacks, to limitless possibilities for new vectors such as deepfakes and quantum computing, IT leaders will have to move far past reactive security. They will need to balance their approach and spend across the triad of people, process, and technology in the year to come.

#### Impact and Result

## Five priorities for the security agenda in 2025

Based on the results of our Info-Tech Future of IT 2024 survey and interviews, this report examines five key priorities that could transform your security efforts in 2025.

### 1\. Operationalize AI Security

**The era of AI is here. Are you ready to tap its potential?**

The AI revolution promises great opportunities and risks for organizations seeking to improve their cybersecurity posture. In 2025, IT leaders will need to ensure that proper guardrails are in place to mitigate risk with AI adoption.

### 2\. Strengthen Your Identity & Access Management Program

**Safeguard your data with a modern approach to identity and access management.**

AI has added a new tool to cybercriminals’ belts – making identity-based attacks easier than ever before and more compelling. Block cybercriminals’ advances with a modern identity & access management program built on zero-trust principles.

### 3\. Build a Resilient Vendor Risk Management Practice

**Establish a game-changing approach to mitigating third-party risk.**

With new third-party breaches making the headlines at an increasingly worrisome rate, IT leaders know they must adopt a risk-based approach to vendor security. See the entire picture through to the finish line with stakeholder engagement and support.

### 4\. Defend Against Deepfake Attacks

**Perceptions of reality are evolving. So should your defense.**

Deepfake attacks have altered reality – leaving employees in the dark about who to trust and where to turn in search of help. Shine a light on AI-powered attacks by developing a resilient incident-response plan powered by people, process, and technology.

### 5\. Prepare for a Post-Quantum Era

**Prepare now to protect against the technologies of tomorrow.**

Advances in technology are bringing us closer to the post-quantum era: a time when encrypted data won’t be as protected as it is now. Threat actors are preparing now to accelerate their attacks with quantum computing – how will you meet this new threat?
