## CIISec

The Chartered Institute of Information Security (CIISec) was the first cyber and information security institution to be granted Royal Charter status and is dedicated to continuously raising standards in the profession. CIISec provides a universally accepted focal point for the cyber and information security profession. It is an independent not-for-profit body governed by its members. It is the natural home for the cyber professional community at every career stage, representing over 35,000 individuals. This is achieved through having programmes that support Development, Recognition and Success.

## Over a Decade of Commitment

CIISec has been unwavering in our commitment to enhancing cyber and information security competency. Our frameworks, born from industry collaboration, have gained acclaim and acceptance.

Queen Elizabeth graciously granted the Chartered Institute of Information Security a Royal Charter of Incorporation at the Privy Council meeting on Wednesday 12th December 2018.

A Royal Charter is an instrument of incorporation, granted by Queen Elizabeth, which confers independent legal personality on an organisation and defines its objectives, constitution and powers to govern its own affairs. Incorporation by Charter is a prestigious way of acquiring legal personality and reflects the high status of that body. Charters are granted rarely, and a body applying for a Charter would normally be expected to demonstrably meet several criteria, regarding its reputation, its standing and its contribution to the profession. CIISec meets those criteria, which reflects how strong and respected our membership is in the professional community and the influence we bring to bear in shaping the information security profession.

The AGM is an opportunity for all members to help to influence the future of CIISec. It is the perfect occasion for the CIISec Chairperson to update attendees on the initiatives that have been taken forward from the previous year and the visions for the coming year. There will be an opportunity for discussion and networking and of course no AGM would be complete without the annual update from the Treasurer.

The AGM is also where new board members will be elected, following voting by Full and Fellow members leading up to the meeting.

It should be noted that non-members are not eligible to attend the CIISec AGM.
