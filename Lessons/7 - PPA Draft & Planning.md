# Lesson 7 - PPA Draft & Planning


---


# First thing : Apology

I probably didn’t explain this properly \(I’ve been working in teams for a long time and missed the obvious\)

After you submit each assignment :

I get a copy of it

I edit my comments in

When I return it the version in your assignment is replaced with my version\.

So never edit it when it’s turned in \(including via the ‘Recents’ in Word / Onedrive / Windows\)

You need to download the returned version\, to carry on with your work\.

# Aim for today / tomorrow

With a Plan

Get started on submitting the PPA & Plan proper

# Checking your idea



* Is the title clear and focused on an issue which can be managed:
  * within the timescale\, available resources and word total?
* Do the title and proposed action plan indicate that you will be capable of:
  * investigating and researching the topic or carrying out the activity or task independently?
* Is there a danger that you will be unable to approach the project impartially and in a balanced way?
* The Project Proposal forms allow everyone opportunity to check the idea against these criteria
* PPA : You
* PPB : Me
* PPC : CIISec expert panel
  * They can and do reject ideas and ask for new PPAs

# Project Proposal Part A:Title of Extended Project

Present the topic to be researched in the form of a short statement / question / hypothesis with clear focus\.

Refer to specific points that you would like to examine / evaluate / develop\.

_You are trying to convince me / _  _CiiSEC_  _ of the suitability of the project working title\, _


---


# PPA: Provide a brief outline of the research or activity/ task to be carried out and sources to be consulted with.

Be detailed – refer to specific sources e\.g\.\, a specific book\, specific articles etc\.

This needs to include specific URLs / Books Papers etc\.

Include your links from the RiOP because I think they only print the PPA/B pages\.

_You are trying to convince us you can find the answer_


---


# PPA : Provide a brief outline of the course of study or area(s) to which the topic relates

Refer directly to which particular  __CyberEPQ module__  and what aspect of it you are seeking to develop and how you plan to do that\.

_You are trying to convince me / _  _CiiSEC_  _ that your question is relevant to and extends/develops from the CyberEPQ\._


---


# PPA : Provide a brief outline of any specific resources and/or equipment you may require, as appropriate

Be specific\.

If you need the Paloalto boxes\, a safe network or other hardware or software list it\.

_You are trying to convince me / _  _CiiSEC_  _ that you have thought about the stuff you might need \(from hardware to questionnaire software etc\.\)_


---


# PPA : Provide a brief outline of your proposed action

Be specific

Refer to any cyber professionals/ experts who you may intend to contact and for what purpose;

Any surveys that you intend to conduct and what you will do with your findings\.

Provide a brief outline of how you plan to further your project  __perhaps month by month__ \. Or refer to your full plan / GANTT Chart

_You are trying to convince me / _  _CiiSEC_  _ that your project / research plan is feasible\. _

# Project Proposal Part B

This is to be completed by the supervisor\.

The supervisor should comment on :\-

the suitability of the project working title\,

how the project proposal extends/develops from the learner’s main course of study\,

and whether the learner’s research plan is feasible\.

# Show the development of your CyberEPQ

The Lead Moderator says : marks were lost due to lack of evidence in showing the development of the CyberEPQ\.

A Gantt chart is one way of doing this and good place for instruction of how to do this with reference to EPQ’s in general can be found on YouTube\.

A good project plan or Gantt chart could help keep your learners aware of deadlines and keep them on track and making progress\.

The EPQ is a project based qualification of 120 hours work and it is  __not only __ an essay that can be written over a period of a week or less\.

# What needs doing in what order.

Track what you have done and changes to the plan\.

Save with different names every so often so you can refer to the changes later\.

Mid\-Project Review Meeting Week 24

Draft Essay in Week 25

Presentations Week 27

End of Project Review\, Summary and Reflection Week 27
