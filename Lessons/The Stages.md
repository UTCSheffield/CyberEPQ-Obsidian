## Research & Planning

A lot of what you will be doing is :

### Research

* Read stuff, record what you found and then use it referencing it properly so readers know where the idea came from.
### Planning

* Write about what you are going to do and when
* Recording your progress and changes that are made

So whilst you are doing the modules the lessons will be about Research and Planning and different software & techniques to use.
