* I'm going to try and keep it so the deadlines I set will give you room to be a week late\, and not fall foul of CIISec’s super strict deadlines\.
  * You will always get a classcharts “Missed Deadline” at a week late for all deadlines\. For Modules this will not recur\, but it will for all other tasks\.
* But for the following Assignments\, being late can get you thrown off the course\, so there are extra motivations\. \(They are marked “:CIISec Deadline” in Teams\)
* “Project Proposal A\, B & Plan” & “Full Project Submission” = 1 classcharts “Missed Deadline” each day over the week
* “PPA Resubmission” We usually get 48 hours\, so I will give you 24 hours with a  classcharts “Missed Deadline” if it’s late\)
