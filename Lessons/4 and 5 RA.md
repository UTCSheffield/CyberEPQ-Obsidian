![[ROIP Brainstorming]]

# Next Steps : MEG Checking your idea


* Is the title clear and focused on an issue which can be managed:
  * within the timescale\, available resources and word total?
* Do the title and proposed action plan indicate that you will be capable of:
  * investigating and researching the topic or carrying out the activity or task independently?
* Is there a danger that you will be unable to approach the project impartially and in a balanced way?

---
# ROIP

* Start your ROIP  \(Page 6 of the Production Log\) by filling in the
  * "Your first idea for topic \(to include overall aim\)" and
  * "Your first ideas for research and development of your project" boxes\.
<!--* And fill in the back up idea form as well.-->

- Can I form it into a question?
- Can I find good information sources?
- Will the idea allow me to include everything required to do well?
- Can I do this safely?
