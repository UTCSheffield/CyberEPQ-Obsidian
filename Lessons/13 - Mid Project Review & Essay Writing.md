## Essay Structure 

Essays should have an **introduction**. a **main body** and a **conclusion**.

You have had a first go at the introduction and conclusion, and that will help inform your planning but you will need to revisit them when the rest is done.

---
## Introduction

* **How** are you going to answer the question
* Define & explain your **key terms** in the essay title
* **Set the scene**
* Outline the **key issues** you will cover in the order you are going to cover them
* **Grab the reader's interest**

---
## Using your evidence

- You discover evidence through your research
- Use that evidence to support & inform your writing
- Use **quotes**, **paraphrasing** or **summarising** to restate your point or prove your points are valid
- It is **important** your evidence is presented alongside your own ideas and opinions not as a substitute for them.
- Whenever you use someone else's ideas or words **use citations and references**

---
## Main body paragraphs

Each paragraph in your main body should be structured like this:

* **Point** - The first sentence in each paragraph introduces the main idea that will be covered in that paragraph
* **Evidence or example** - Give evidence or an example to illustrate your point
* **Explanation** - How does the evidence or example illustrates your point and how it relates to the essay title.

---

## Conclusion

* **Draw essay together**
* **Summarise** the main themes, ideas and points
* State your **answer** to the question 
* **Explain** why that is important
* Try and use your last sentence as final answer **linking to the title**
* **Do not introduce any new ideas**

## Harvard Style referencing

In Text (the <font color="#ff0000">Red</font> is just for demonstration, do not use) : 

Referencing is inextricably linked to the concept of plagiarism; it involves learning how to represent what has been learned from earlier authors<font color="#F00"> (Pears and Shields, 2008, p. 18)</font>. As an “essential skill for higher education” <font color="#F00">(Neville, 2009, p. 95)</font> it substantiates the evidence on which discussion or argument is based. The skills discussed here are part of a community of practice for those seeking to reduce inequalities in higher education access <font color="#F00">(‘About NERUPI’)</font>
