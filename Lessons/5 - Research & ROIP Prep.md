# Next Steps : MEG Checking your idea



* Is the title clear and focused on an issue which can be managed:
  * within the timescale\, available resources and word total?
* Do the title and proposed action plan indicate that you will be capable of:
  * investigating and researching the topic or carrying out the activity or task independently?
* Is there a danger that you will be unable to approach the project impartially and in a balanced way?

# SMARTER

Specific \- What exactly will you do?

Measurable \- how will you know you’ve succeeded?

Achievable \- is it realistic?

Resourced \- have you allocated enough time? Have you got enough information?

Timetabled \- by when will you achieve each step?

Evaluated \- keep checking if you are on track

Reviewed \- sometimes changed circumstances mean a modification in the goal is necessary

# Task : What areas are you interested in?



* __Brainstorm ideas __
  * No bad ideas at this stage
  * What did you find interesting / exciting\.
  * What questions could you ask?
* __Mind Map ??__
  * [https://tinyurl\.com/ROIPmm](https://tinyurl.com/ROIPmm)  [https://mermaid\.live/](https://mermaid.live/)
  * If you have done your Specialist / Innovation Module
    * Delete the others \(to tidy up\)
  * For each module
    * Think about what you saw
      * Was it interesting / exciting?
      * Did it raise any questions?
      * If Not delete the module \(to tidy up\, I expect most of you to delete a lot of the modules\)

# Task : Places you can research your topics

For each of your initial ideas do a search and try to find info about it\.

You can log your searches and what good things you find in any of these ways\.

<span style="color:#242424">"Search Progress" \(in the assignment and by far the easiest\) </span>

<span style="color:#242424">Zotero on your own machine and upload it's info here \(tag each idea separately\)</span>

<span style="color:#242424">Copy the blank "Evaluation Table of Resources" for each idea and upload it here \(will need different names for each one\)</span>

<span style="color:#242424">If you can't find at least 3 good sites for info it's not a good idea ? Wikipedia is not a good source but it’s references are often a great place to look\.</span>

<span style="color:#242424">You should find at least 3 specific sites for at least 2 ideas\.</span>

# Next Steps

__Brainstorm ideas __

<span style="color:#5e5e5e"> __Initial Research __ </span>

<span style="color:#5e5e5e"> __Filter the ideas__ </span>

Can I form it into a question?

Can I find good information sources?

Will the idea allow me to include everything required to do well?

Can I do this safely?
