## Teams : CyberEPQ Full Project

We will use this one Assignment for most work until the end of the course. But warning 

**NEVER WORK ON AN ASSIGNMENT IF IT IS TURNED IN.** 

Either "un-turn in" or wait for me to "Return  for Improvement". I will use the CyberEPQ Marking Grid which allows me to feedback on every AO and clearly show where you are up to. 

BUT because the final mark is done on "best fit", the mark you have on here is likely to be slightly higher than the final mark I can give. Use it for guidance about what to work on not a prediction.

## Planning your Written Work & Essay  

Essay planning is where we can get the other marks for planning and organisation. Use mindmaps or other diagrams  / lists to map out your answers to your question and what info backs each bit.

## Essay Writing Activity 2

1. Write a 300 word-ish draft conclusion (answer to the question) (summary of the key arguments) of your EPQ project. This can include in-text citations but will largely be opinions. You can use this to make sure the body of the essay justifies your answer.
2. Make an essay plan

	1. To get between your introduction and answer what are you going to need to show / explain ?
	2. What info / source helps do that, are you missing any sources?
	3. Are there other opinions and why do you think yours is better?
3. Submit these in “CyberEPQ Full Project”

## Harvard Style referencing

In Text (the <font color="#ff0000">Red</font> is just for demonstration, do not use) : 

Referencing is inextricably linked to the concept of plagiarism; it involves learning how to represent what has been learned from earlier authors<font color="#F00"> (Pears and Shields, 2008, p. 18)</font>. As an “essential skill for higher education” <font color="#F00">(Neville, 2009, p. 95)</font> it substantiates the evidence on which discussion or argument is based. The skills discussed here are part of a community of practice for those seeking to reduce inequalities in higher education access <font color="#F00">(‘About NERUPI’)</font>
