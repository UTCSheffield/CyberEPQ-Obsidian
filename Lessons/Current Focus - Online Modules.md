## Current Focus - Online Modules

* Make sure you are signed up properly (can you access Module 2?)
* Do your modules (1-8)
	* Journal Entry for each Module
* June Starters - one each fortnight will get you to the end in time
* September Starters - roughly one module a week will do
* The Teams & Class Charts deadlines for each module will be based on the September start.

## Bad News

* All my deadlines (including those for Modules) will be in Class Charts & Teams.
* CIISec Manage the course and their deadlines get tight towards the end & I usually have marking / feedback to do before their deadline.
* We will start with standard OLP 6th Form "Missed Deadlines Policy" in Computing. 
	* A Class Charts "Missed Deadline" will be marked 7 days after my deadline
	* But this will shorten to 1 day towards the end of the course.

* You are committed to 4 hours a week (inc. 1 hour with me)
* Dropping out of the course does cost money

## The use of AI within the CyberEPQ

The CyberEPQ is an independent task and work you produce from it must be your own. Students who misuse AI such that the work they submit for assessment is not their own will have committed malpractice, in accordance with the JCQ regulations. Please see the JCQ regulations belowÂ
