# The backbone of your project is your research

Most important thing about your question / title is can you find reliable information sources about it?

1. Do a search for each idea\. Can you find some info \(specific urls and sites\)\.
2. Record the things you find in an “Evaluation Table of Resources” or Zotero
3. If using Zotero use Notes & Tags to keep track of why stuff is useful and for what idea it is connected\.

* An investigation into a cyber security related topic of your choice\.

  * Forms for all the stages of the project

# Checking your idea



* Is the title clear and focused on an issue which can be managed:
  * within the timescale\, available resources and word total?
* Do the title and proposed action plan indicate that you will be capable of:
  * investigating and researching the topic or carrying out the activity or task independently?
* Is there a danger that you will be unable to approach the project impartially and in a balanced way?

# SMARTER

Specific \- What exactly will you do?

Measurable \- how will you know you’ve succeeded?

Achievable \- is it realistic?

Resourced \- have you allocated enough time? Have you got enough information?

Timetabled \- by when will you achieve each step?

Evaluated \- keep checking if you are on track

Reviewed \- sometimes changed circumstances mean a modification in the goal is necessary
