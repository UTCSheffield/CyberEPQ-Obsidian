## Mindmapping

  * [https://tinyurl\.com/ROIPmm](https://tinyurl.com/ROIPmm)  [https://mermaid\.live/](https://mermaid.live/)
  * For each module
    * Think about what you saw
      * Was it interesting / exciting?
      * Did it raise any questions?
      * If Not delete the module \(to tidy up\, I expect most of you to delete a lot of the modules\)
  * Remember to save the image and text somewhere

# Then filter the ideas

What does the project need to allow me to include?

What my question will I have to let me do?

Can I find info safely?

---
## The backbone of your project is your research

The most important thing about your project is : **Can you find reliable information sources about it?**

1. Do a search for each idea. Can you find some info (specific urls and sites).

## Checking your idea

* Is the title clear and focused on an issue which can be managed:
  * within the timescale, available resources and word total?
* Do the title and proposed action plan indicate that you will be capable of:
  * investigating and researching the topic or carrying out the activity or task independently?
* Is there a danger that you will be unable to approach the project impartially and in a balanced way?
