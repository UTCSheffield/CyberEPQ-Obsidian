  * For each module
    * Think about what you saw
      * Was it interesting / exciting?
      * Did it raise any questions?
      * If Not delete the module \(to tidy up\, I expect most of you to delete a lot of the modules\)
  * Remember to save the image and text somewhere

## Checking your idea

* Is the title clear and focused on an issue which can be managed:
  * within the timescale, available resources and word total?
* Do the title and proposed action plan indicate that you will be capable of:
  * investigating and researching the topic or carrying out the activity or task independently?
* Is there a danger that you will be unable to approach the project impartially and in a balanced way?

## Research for ROIP

The most important thing about your project is : **Can you find reliable information sources about it?**

You can log your searches and what good things you find in any of these ways.
- Search Progress" (in the assignment and by far the easiest) 
- Obsidian Web Clipper (the most integrated)
- Copy the blank "Evaluation Table of Resources" for each idea and upload it here (will need different names for each one)
- Zotero

**If you can't find at least 3 good sites for info it's not a good idea ? Wikipedia is not a good source but it’s references are often a great place to look.**
You should find at least 3 specific sites for at least 2 ideas.

# SMARTER Targets

- **Specific** - What exactly will you do?
- **Measurable** - How will you know you’ve succeeded?
- **Achievable** - Is it realistic?
- **Resourced** - Have you allocated enough time? Have you got enough information?
- **Time Tabled** - By when will you achieve each step?
- **Evaluated** - Keep checking if you are on track
- **Reviewed** - Sometimes changed circumstances mean a modification in the goal is necessary
