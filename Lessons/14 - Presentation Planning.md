# What makes a good oral presentation?



* A good presentation is\.\.\.
  * Obviously well prepared and thoroughly rehearsed
  * Clear and easy for a non\-specialist audience to understand
  * Sensitive to the needs and interests of the audience
  * Engaging and stimulating
  * Concise and clearly structured with an introduction\, main section\, conclusion and ‘take\-home message’
  * Clearly argued lines of reasoning leading to a logical conclusion
  * Well\-paced\, with polished\, confident\, clearly audible delivery
  * Delivered in a relaxed manner\, maintaining rapport and eye contact with the audience
  * Supported by well prepared and relevant visual aids which support the presentation rather than leading it\.

---






* A good presentation isn’t\.\.\.
  * Prepared on the back of an envelope in ten minutes
  * Run through for the first time in front of its audience
  * Too technical or complex\, assuming that the audience are experts
  * Irrelevant\, dull or patronising towards the audience
  * Muddled\, with no clear structure to distinguish or link the parts together
  * An inconsistent\, illogical or unsubstantiated rant
  * Gabbled breathlessly to get it over with as quickly as possible
  * Stumbled through painfully with lots of errs\.\.\. and umms\.\.\.
  * Read from notes without any audience contact
  * Read through from a screen filled with lots of densely packed text\.

---




# Summary…



  * Five hints for successful presentations:
  * Plan\, prepare and rehearse thoroughly\.
  * Keep it simple\.
    * Max 7 points of 7 words on a slide
  * Your screen is not your script
    * Use images to support what you say\.
    * We can rig a screen with notes / tele\-prompter
  * Introduction\, Main section & Conclusion
  * Engage with your audience\.

# Planning an Oral Presentation

We will do them in Maker Lab with each other as the audience\. Bear this in mind

Are there questions you want your colleagues to ask

Do we need to be careful of someone's colour blindness ???
