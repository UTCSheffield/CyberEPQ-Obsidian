## What does the project need to allow me to include?  

* **Identify, design, plan and complete an individual project**, applying a range of organisational skills and strategies to meet agreed objectives.
* **Obtain, critically select and use information from a range of sources**; analyse data, apply it appropriately and demonstrate understanding of any relevant, connections and complexities of the topic.
* **Select and use a range of skills**, including new technologies, solve problems, take decisions critically, creatively and flexibly, to achieve planned outcomes.
* **Evaluate outcomes** both in relation to agreed objectives, as well as own learning and performance.

## Research / Evaluation Table of Resources

In order to achieve high marks you need to build on the work of others in a way that 



An Evaluation Table of Resources is an acceptable way to evidence how resources have been evaluated throughout the project. This can be done as a spreadsheet and may look like this. When completing how useful the source was, it could be beneficial to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the source, as well as how it was used in your project

## Checking your idea

* Is the title clear and focused on an issue which can be managed:
	* within the timescale, available resources and word total?
* Do the title and proposed action plan indicate that you will be capable of:
	* investigating and researching the topic or carrying out the activity or task independently?
* Is there a danger that you will be unable to approach the project impartially and in a balanced way?
