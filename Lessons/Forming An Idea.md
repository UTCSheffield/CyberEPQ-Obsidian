### What To Investigate

Very rarely in life are we offered a completely free choice, so starting an Extended Project can be quite frightening.

But there will be some restrictions.
* How much choice do you really have?
* What format should your project take?

 The first thing to consider is which module or modules you are interested in from the CyberEPQ course and how you would like to develop them further.
